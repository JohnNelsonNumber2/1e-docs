# SCHEMA
Every instruction you write for `Endpoint Troubleshooting` (a `Question` or `Action`) and every automation you write for `Endpoint Automation` (a `Check`, `Fix` or `PreCondition`) must have a schema created for it.  

The schema tells the platform what the shape of the data is that's being returned from the 1E Client.
It defines the names of the columns, as well as the data types
