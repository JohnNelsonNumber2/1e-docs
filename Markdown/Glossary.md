# Glossary
This page contains a glossary of terms and abbreviations that may be seen in the SCALE documentation which need defining.

## Automation
A `PreCondition`, `Check` or `Fix` in `Endpoint Automation` (formerly known as `Guaranteed State`) is an automation.

Sometimes people use instruction to mean both instructions and automations created with TIMS, but to be precise, an automation is PreCondition, Check or Fix.

## Client
a.k.a 1E Client, 1E Agent
 
This is the service that executes instructions and automations--which were written in SCALE--and runs at the endpoints under the `root` or `SYSTEM` context.

This is the carriage-return (ASCII-13) character. This is the first half of the string that gets put into a text editor when you type `ENTER` in Windows

## CRLF
Carriage-return-line-feed
 
This is the equivalent of hitting `ENTER` on your keyboard which puts the carriage-return (ASCII-13) and line-feed (ASCII-10) characters in the editor in Windows

## Instruction
A `Question` or `Action` in `Endpoint Troubleshooting` (formerly known as `Explorer`) is an instruction.

Sometimes people use instruction to mean any instruction or automation you create with TIMS, but to be precise, an instruction is a question or action.
